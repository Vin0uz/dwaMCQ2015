#**RETROSPECTIVE**

###**Objectives**

- Our main goal was to do a usable website. _Done_
- Create a mobileApp which can use the website. _Not Done_
- Possibility to turn online (/offline) mcq's. _Done_
- Do statistics about result. _Not Done_

###**Difficulties**

First of all, the main difficulty we faced was to choose how to build the website. The fact is that we were not aware about all the technologies we ll be able to use when we started the project. So we started with Thymeleaf first, and then when we learned about AngularJS we tried to use it with Thymeleaf too, and we lost so much time trying to do that.
We also face some difficulties about the JS part : a syntax error is detected but not print, so we needed to code and check often to do not make this kind of mistake..
We didn't do a style for the website, only for some buttons to show we are able to do, but decided to do not loose time with that.

###**Lessons**


There is **NO** better documentation for AngularJS than the [AngularJS website](https://angularjs.org/), even if the [W3School Website](http://www.w3schools.com/angular/) is good too.
Another lesson is that we wanted to start the project early, before having other project, and finally that was a mistake, because we started early, with the technologies we knew and we lost a lot of time trying to use both technologies. 


###**Keep for the next time**

The subject was really interesting, and allows to do some Development Choices (how many answers, how many true answer(s), share mcq with everybody or no  etc..)
It was cool to add one month for the delay but in fact, we didnt work so much during the added month (at least one week in our family for Christmas, working in other Project, preparing for exams).


###**Change for the next time**

We ll probably wait to have _"all cards in hand"_ before starting to code. AngularJS is, at the end, the technology we used and it was the last in the Course Program.

Try to make a stricter working plan with deadlines about developping :

- Finish the first part before the XX/XX/XXXX , the second one before XX/XX/XXX etc..
- Establish exactly who do what and how.
- Make the Development choices before start anything.

Use Git more efficently (only one committer in this project)


###**What's next**

If somebody wants to continue our project, there is some ideas to implement :

  - Several True Answers Questions MCQ
  - Penalty in case of Wrong Answer
  - Timer on Question
  - Create _Group_ of MCQ that can be seen as Course
  - Timer for MCQ :
    - Opening a waiting room for a MCQ
    - The MCQ is launched for everybody in the same time
    - Timers on Questions
  - Create more data about result :
    - MeanGrade of a form
    - MeanGrade of a User on another User Forms
    - MeanGrade in a _Group_ (by User, by Form etc..)
    - How are evolving the MeanGrades
    - Add Weight on some Form to compute mean of Group (that can be seen as Practictal Sessions Grading)
